(** [diff t1 t2] returns the pair [(c, p)], with [c] being the cost
  to change [t1] into [t2] and [p] the corresponding patch.
  @param fcost can be used to specify alternative cost functions.
  @param cut is called on XML tree tag nodes; returning [true] means
  that that subnodes won't be compared separately, but the whole node
  will be compared as is. This is useful in case of big XML trees, otherwise
  a lot of comparisons are done between the two trees. For example,
  one can cut on "p", "pre", "ul" and "code" tags in a regular web page.
  Default behaviour is to cut nothing.
